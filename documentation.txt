./run.sh to run all clients at once

To change the algorithm, go into server.py and Ctrl+F for "fl.server.strategy.FedAvg" and replace FedAvg with any of the provided FL algorithms
- Provided: 
    - FaultTolerantFedAvg
    - FedAdagrad
    - FedAdam 
    - FedAvgAndroid
    - FedAvgM (Federated Averaging with Momentum)
    - FedOpt (Adapted Federated Optimization)
    - FedYogi (Adaptive Federated Optimization using Yogi)
    - QFedAvg
 - To run FedProx, set accept_failures=True for the server strategy and add the proximal term to "optimizer" on line 56 of client.py

Modifying hyperparameters:
- Change batch size
    - Change in client.py and utils.py
- Change epochs
    - Change in client.py and utils.py
- Change learning rate (lr) and momentum 
    - Line 55 of client.py
- Change FL hyperparameters: fraction_fit, num_rounds, accept_failures, etc.
    - Lines 43-47 of server.py
- Change training/test set sizes
    - You can do this in load_partition() in utils.py
- Tweak NN implementation in client.py
